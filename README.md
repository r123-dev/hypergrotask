Clone the Repository: If you haven't already, clone your repository containing the Node.js backend code to your local machine.

Install Dependencies: Navigate to the project directory in your terminal and run the following command to install the required dependencies:

bash
Copy code
npm install
Set Up Environment Variables: Create a .env file in the root of your project to store environment variables like database connection details, API keys, etc. Here's an example of what your .env file might look like:

plaintext
Copy code
PORT=3000
MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/stockapp
Replace MONGODB_URI with your actual MongoDB connection URI.

Run the Server: Start the Node.js server by running the following command:

bash
Copy code
npm start
This command will start your Node.js server, and if everything is set up correctly, you should see a message indicating that the server is running.

Using the API: Now that your server is running, you can use the API endpoints. Here are some examples of how you can use the API:

Get Top 10 Stocks: Send a GET request to /api/stocks/top to retrieve the top 10 stocks.

Example:

bash
Copy code
curl http://localhost:3000/api/stocks/top10
Find Stocks by Name: Send a GET request to /api/stocks/search?name=<stock_name> to search for stocks by name.
